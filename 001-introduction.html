    <h1> is the Main Heading</h1>
    <p> text might be an introduction to the rest of
        the page. And if the page is a long one it might
        be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
    <h2> is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
        you follow the structure of what is being written.
        There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
        headings).</p>
    <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
